componet inside another component is called component compostion

  const Heading = () => {

jsx component have only one parent

React.Fragment is component whic is exported by react and it like a empty tag

inline style in react

can i use React.Fragnent inside React.Fragment ?

array join using comma ?

config driven UI ?
optional chaing ?
props?

argument --passing aruguments abc(a,b)
parameter --receave parameter function abc(a,b)

virtua DOM --we keep represention of DOM in our code it is called virtual DOM 

why do we need virtual DOM in react?

we need virtualDOM for reconceliation react?

Reconceliation is an algorithm React uses to diff one tree from other .(diff algorith). it determines what need to change what  not need to change exactly   ....



this diff algorith react uses and this process is called Reconsiliation



React uses virtual DOM .It is repesentation of DOM it is not actual DOM and React use something known as reconciliation . reconcilition is aprocess where we have diff algorithm which find out the difference between tress when we found out the  difference it will rerender only the portion that is required.


tree is virtual repesention of DOM.

what is React Fibre (React 16)?
New Reconciliation engine this is doing diff now -->

config.js or constant.js ----> all the hardcode things we can put in this file
<!-- ------------------- -->
useEffect is called after the component is render. Two things we pass inside
useeffect is it takes call back and dependency array. if empty array then calls
after initial render only. if donot pass dependency array the use effect will
call after every render never write useeffect inside if else. usestate is a hook
that react give , Never use useState outside of functional component

<!-- SPA - single Page Application in which complete Page does not rerender -->

<!-- There are Two types of routing 
client side routing 
server side routing --routes come from server -->

<!-- why we use Link instead anchor tag ?

Because react router DOM keeping track of  this Link behind the scene -->

<!-- all children go inside outlet  -->
